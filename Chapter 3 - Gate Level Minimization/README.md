# NOT_NOR_AND Verilog Practice

## Overview
This project is a simple combinational logic practice using NOT, NOR, and AND operations.
The design demonstrates how logic expressions can be constructed and verified using Verilog HDL.

## Logic Description
- Internal signal `D` is generated using NOT and OR operations  
  - `D = !(!A || B)`
- Output `Y` is generated by AND-ing signal `D` with input `C`  
  - `Y = C && D`
- Final Boolean expression:
  - `Y = C AND (NOT ( (NOT A) OR B ))`

- `NOT_NOR_AND_TB.v` : Testbench used for functional simulation
- `NOT_NOR_AND.pdf` : Logic schematic and simulation waveform (combined)

## Simulation & Verification
- All input combinations of A, B, and C were applied in the testbench
- Simulation waveform confirms correct behavior of NOT, NOR, and AND logic
- Output changes match the expected Boolean expression

## Tools
- Quartus Prime Lite Edition
- ModelSim-Altera

## Notes
- This design contains only combinational logic
- No clock or sequential elements are used
- The project focuses on understanding logic inversion and signal dependency
