Project: OR_AND
Date: 2026-01-01

Description:
This project implements a simple combinational logic circuit using Verilog HDL.

Logic:
- D = A OR B
- E = C AND D

Inputs:
- A, B, C

Output:
- E

Verification:
A testbench was written to apply all input combinations.
Simulation waveform confirms that output E behaves correctly
according to the intended OR-AND logic.

Tools:
- Quartus Prime Lite
- ModelSim-Altera
